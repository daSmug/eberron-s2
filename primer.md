#### Season 2 - An Agency on the Brink

In a city filled with corrupt guards, the growing turf war between the **BOROMAR CLAN** and **DAASK** led to the call to fight fire with fire. The Armed Response Agency was created as a response to these escalating threats within **SHARN**, the City of Towers. 

Recently, the Agency has had a string of bad luck. Cases have ended poorly, and threats of a budget cut loom unless the team can turn things around. Yet there are factions within Sharn who would love to see the axe fall on the Agency, and who will work against your recovery attempt.

##### Location
Sharn, City of Towers. Largest city in the world, located in the nation of Breland. A literal mile high city composed of towers built within towers. Watch out for that drop.

##### Factions
- **Boromar Clan**
	- Halfling gangsters with a lot of political sway in the city.
- **Daask**
	- Monsters, 'terrorists' to some, muscling in on the Boromar clan.
- **King's Citadel**
	- The organization you all work for, a branch of the government's military arm.


**Game:** Entirely City-based
**Politics:** Medium
**Roleplaying:** Medium
**Tactics:** Medium
**Player Buy-In:** I'm wanting to run a game where the PCs have worked together for some time; they know each other, they're close-knit. They may not like each other, but they're all working for the Greater Good. 
- All PCs must have a vested interest in seeing that Sharn, and Breland, lives to see another day. 
- All PCs should be interested in seeing the Agency survives.
- All PCs were recruited because they are special and good at their jobs. You're level 5 baby! You're elite. Most NPCs never go past level 1.

**PC Notes**
- You're all level 5, take a feat + 1 ASI at level 4.
- The PCs should be from Breland, if not from Sharn directly.
- Sharn is mostly humans (33%), then dwarves (16%), halflings, goblinoids, gnomes (~9%), elves (7%), half-elves (5%), shifters (4%), changelings (3%), orcs/half-orcs (2%).
	

#### We're going to do a Session 0 with a relationship board, so have a think about...
- What your character did during the Last War, which went for 100 years and only ended 2 years ago.
	- You may have served in the Last War, fighting for Breland against the other nations.
	- If you didn't, then a lot of people you know probably did. A good percentage did not come back.
- What your character did that brought them to the attention of Knight-Marshal Banarak Tithon, the deadliest swordsman in the land, and your boss.
	- Was it something in the War?
	- Were you a recommendation from a powerful figure within the government, or a Dragonmarked House?
- What your character has in Sharn that makes them want to see it survive. 
- Some backstory knives:
	- Does your character owe someone? What, why, and who? 
	- Is your character mixed up with the Boromar Clan, or any number of other factions that are present.
		- The Boromar Clan, Daask, the Tyrants, the Redcloak Battalion, the various religious factions, the cults, there's a lot.
	- Or... how is your character's family mixed up with this group instead?
