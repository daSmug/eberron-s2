## Season 2 - An Agency on the Brink

In a city filled with corrupt guards, the growing turf war between the **BOROMAR CLAN** and **DAASK** led to the call to fight fire with fire. The Armed Response Agency was created as a response to these escalating threats within **SHARN**, the City of Towers. 

Recently, the Agency has had a string of bad luck. Cases have ended poorly, and threats of a budget cut loom unless the team can turn things around. Yet there are factions within Sharn who would love to see the axe fall on the Agency, and who will work against your recovery attempt.

### Location
Sharn, City of Towers. Largest city in the world, located in the nation of Breland. A literal mile high city composed of towers built within towers. Watch out for that drop.

### Factions
- **Boromar Clan**
	- Halfling gangsters with a lot of political sway in the city.
- **Daask**
	- Monsters, 'terrorists' to some, muscling in on the Boromar clan.
- **King's Citadel**
	- The organization you all work for, a branch of the government's military arm.

### Game Notes
**Game:** Entirely City-based  
**Politics:** Medium  
**Roleplaying:** Medium  
**Tactics:** Medium

**Player Buy-In:** I'm wanting to run a game where the PCs have worked together for some time; they know each other, they're close-knit. They may not like each other, but they're all working for the Greater Good. 
- All PCs must have a vested interest in seeing that Sharn, and Breland, lives to see another day. 
- All PCs should be interested in seeing the Agency survives.
- All PCs were recruited because they are special and good at their jobs. You're level 5 baby! You're elite. Most NPCs never go past level 1.

**PC Notes**
- You're all level 5, take a feat + 1 ASI at level 4.
- The PCs should be from Breland, if not from Sharn directly.
- Sharn is mostly humans (33%), then dwarves (16%), halflings, goblinoids, gnomes (~9%), elves (7%), half-elves (5%), shifters (4%), changelings (3%), orcs/half-orcs (2%).
	

#### We're going to do a Session 0 with a relationship board, so have a think about...
- What your character did during the Last War, which went for 100 years and only ended 2 years ago.
	- You may have served in the Last War, fighting for Breland against the other nations.
	- If you didn't, then a lot of people you know probably did. A good percentage did not come back.
- What good and bad experiences your character has had.
- 	- Smug will be asking for one good and one bad thing that happened to the character for each level-up.
- What your character did that brought them to the attention of Knight-Marshal Banarak Tithon, the deadliest swordsman in the land, and your boss. The recruitment likely happened at level 4, and the team has progressed to level 5 in the last year.
	- Was it something in the War?
	- Were you a recommendation from a powerful figure within the government, or a Dragonmarked House?
- What your character has in Sharn that makes them want to see it survive. 
- Some backstory knives:
	- Does your character owe someone? What, why, and who? 
	- Is your character mixed up with the Boromar Clan, or any number of other factions that are present.
		- The Boromar Clan, Daask, the Tyrants, the Redcloak Battalion, the various religious factions, the cults, there's a lot.
	- Or... how is your character's family mixed up with this group instead?


#### Common Knowledge
- Your character likely knows all this and then some: https://keith-baker.com/dm-common-knowledge/
- Primo resource for looking things up in the Eberron setting: https://eberron.tiddlyhost.com/


#### The Agency
- Established just over a year ago as a division of the [King's Citadel](https://eberron.tiddlyhost.com/#King's%20Citadel) in Sharn.
- Primary goal was to be an answer to the higher-powered monster threat of Daask, or any Cults, really anything that's beyond the capability of the Sharn Watch.
- Stu's character is in charge of the Agency.
- The Agency answers to [Knight-Marshal Banarak Tithon](https://eberron.tiddlyhost.com/#Banarak%20Tithon).
- As an extension of the King's Citadel, the Agency has reach - likely similar to the FBI where they can come in and claim jurisdiction.


#### Sharn
- The Sharn Watch is fairly corrupt. They won't investigate things a noble doesn't want investigated, they'll be bribed by the Boromar Clan, they won't stick their neck out to help unless they've got a really solid reason to.
	- The Blackened Book is a special division of the Sharn Watch who are less corrupt, and tend to deal with magical threats.
- The Boromar Clan is an old halfling mafia that run a good portion of the city. They've even got elected officials and ties to the Dragonmarked Houses.
